# TransparentScreenLock
Transparent Screen Lock for Windows. As there doesn't seem to be another equivalent out there right now this simple Powershell script will use the default Windows bubbles.scr file to act as a transparent screen lock.

This will invoke the .scr file and then monitor the process to ensure the screen is locked via the usual lock screen call once user input is detected.

- Obviously a screen full of bubbles isn't ideal but this will do until I find another transparent .scr file that can be used.
